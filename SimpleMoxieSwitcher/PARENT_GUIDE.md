## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What age is this app appropriate for?**
A: The app is designed for children ages 5-13, with content ranging from preschool to adult levels. You can adjust difficulty, reading level, and complexity for any age.

**Q: Do I need an internet connection?**
A: Yes, for most features that generate content (Stories, Learning, Language, Music). The app connects to OpenAI's API and your Moxie robot over the network.

**Q: Can I use this without a Moxie robot?**
A: Yes! Many features work standalone (Stories, Learning, Language practice, Music). Robot control features require a physical Moxie robot.

**Q: How much does the OpenAI API cost?**
A: OpenAI charges per usage. Most features use the economical "gpt-4o-mini" model. Typical usage:
- A story: ~$0.01-0.05
- A learning session: ~$0.02-0.10
